# Dot Frontend Test

## Setup Instructions
 - git clone [Your Repository URL]
 - cd dot-frontend-test

## Assumptions and Design Decisions
- I'm assuming the tester will run the server locally concurrently as this client side application to be able to see the client-server interactions. 
- I followed the screenshots shared in the project description and use my discretion on some parts.

## Additional Features Implemented
- Utility functions to extract product categories for sidebar menu options (/utils/extractCategories.ts)

## Areas for Improvement
- Adding debouncing to the product search so it doesn't make api call at every change of input field character
